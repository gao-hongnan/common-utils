**Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)** is a memory optimization strategy for distributed deep learning models. As model sizes continue to grow, fitting them into GPU memory becomes increasingly challenging. ZeRO aims to alleviate this by partitioning the different states of the model and optimizer across available GPUs, allowing for the training of models that were previously too large to fit on a single GPU.

In the context of DeepSpeed, a library developed by Microsoft which integrates with PyTorch, ZeRO is divided into several stages of optimization:

1. **ZeRO-1 (Optimizer State Partitioning)**:
   - The optimizer states (like momentum and variance for Adam) are partitioned across the GPUs.
   - Each GPU gets a portion of the optimizer state and only updates that portion.
   - This reduces the memory required for the optimizer states, allowing for larger models or larger batch sizes.

2. **ZeRO-2 (Gradient Accumulation without memory duplication)**:
   - In typical data parallelism, each GPU maintains a full copy of the gradients, which are then averaged across GPUs. ZeRO-2 aims to reduce the memory required for gradients.
   - Gradients are divided across the GPUs such that each GPU only has a partition of the total gradient.
   - These gradient partitions are averaged and combined without creating full gradient replicas on each GPU.

3. **ZeRO-3 (Parameter Partitioning)**:
   - The model parameters themselves are partitioned across the GPUs.
   - Each GPU only maintains and updates a portion of the parameters.
   - This allows the distributed system to train models larger than the memory of a single GPU.
   - During the forward and backward pass, parameters are exchanged among GPUs as required, which introduces some communication overhead.

For the optimal trade-off between memory savings and computation overhead, users might combine stages. For example, using ZeRO-2 can offer a good balance, providing significant memory savings while maintaining computational efficiency.

It's also worth noting that there are advanced techniques that combine ZeRO with other methods such as offloading optimizer states and gradients to CPU memory or using model parallelism in tandem with ZeRO to train even larger models.
