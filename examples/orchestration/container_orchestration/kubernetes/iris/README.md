# Kubernetes

I would be glad to help you get a good understanding of Kubernetes (K8s) within the next five days. Here's an outline of the topics we're going to cover:

- Introduction to Kubernetes Concepts
- Kubernetes Manifest Files and Object Types
- Setting Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster
- Deploying Applications using Docker Containers
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Scaling and Rolling Updates
- Services and Networking
- Persistent Storage and Volumes
- Health Checks and Monitoring

Let's start with the **Introduction to Kubernetes Concepts**:

1. **Pods**: The smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and can contain one or more containers.

2. **Services**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable loose coupling between dependent Pods.

3. **Volumes**: A directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. Kubernetes supports many types of Volumes, allowing you to work with files and storage systems, including your local filesystem and network storage systems like NFS.

4. **Namespaces**: Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. They let you partition resources into logically named groups.

5. **Deployments**: An API object that manages a replicated application, typically by running Pods with the same container(s).

Now, let's get into **Kubernetes Manifest Files and Object Types**:

A Kubernetes Manifest File is a definition in YAML or JSON format that defines an object or a set of objects in Kubernetes. It's usually used to create, modify, or control Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.

For example, let's take a simple YAML definition for a Kubernetes Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: iris-training-deployment
  labels:
    app: iris-training
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: iris-training
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: iris-training
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: iris-training
        image: iris-training:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8501
```

This manifest file describes a Deployment which runs 3 replicas of the `my-app:1.0.0` container. Each replica is exposing port 8080.

In the next session, we will learn how to **Set Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster**.
